# Validator Pro Telegram Bot

## Overview
Validator Pro is a Telegram bot offering bulk email and phone number validation services with a subscription-based model. It validates emails via DNS, MX record, and SMTP checks, and phone numbers using Google's libphonenumber for carrier detection, country identification, and format validation. The bot supports various file formats (CSV, Excel, TXT), provides detailed validation reports, and features a freemium model with trial usage and paid subscriptions. Its business vision is to provide a reliable, efficient, and user-friendly solution for businesses and individuals needing to verify large lists of contacts, with ambitions to become a leading tool in data hygiene and contact management.

- **PAYMENT API SET AS DEFAULT SYSTEM (August 2, 2025)**: System 2 (BlockBee Payment API) is now the primary payment system running on port 5000. Features comprehensive cryptocurrency payments (BTC, USDT, ETH, LTC), automatic 30-day subscription activation, Telegram notifications, webhook processing, payment tracking, and duplicate prevention. Legacy system moved to port 5002 with webhook forwarding. Complete end-to-end flow: payment creation → confirmation → subscription activation → user notification.

- **HARDCODED VALUES ELIMINATED (August 2, 2025)**: Removed all hardcoded configuration values from the codebase. All critical settings are now environment variable-based with proper validation. Added comprehensive configuration system with 25+ configurable parameters including API endpoints, timeouts, limits, pricing, and validation settings. Created complete environment variables documentation. System now enforces required variables (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ADMIN_CHAT_ID, BLOCKBEE_API_KEY) and provides sensible defaults for optional settings.

- **SMTP AUTHENTICATION ADDED (August 3, 2025)**: Enhanced email validation system with optional SMTP authentication support. When SMTP credentials are configured (SMTP_SERVER, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD), the system performs authenticated SMTP testing for 98%+ validation accuracy. Supports Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and custom SMTP servers. Falls back to basic SMTP connectivity testing when credentials aren't configured. Added comprehensive SMTP configuration documentation.

- **ALL MOCK IMPLEMENTATIONS ELIMINATED (August 3, 2025)**: Completed production readiness by removing all placeholder, mock, and fake data implementations. System now uses real database storage for validation results, authentic progress tracking, operational file serving on port 5001, and complete BlockBee cryptocurrency payment integration. All validation handlers integrated with real progress tracker and database storage. Demo payment functions disabled for production use.

## System Architecture

### Bot Framework
The bot utilizes the `python-telegram-bot` library, built with an async/await pattern for concurrent processing. It employs a modular handler pattern for various functionalities (e.g., start, subscription, validation, dashboard) and features rich interactive menus using Telegram's inline keyboard system.

### Database Layer
Leveraging SQLAlchemy ORM, the database layer provides abstraction with declarative models. It is configurable for SQLite (development) or PostgreSQL (production) and includes context-managed database sessions with proper cleanup, and foreign key relationships between users, subscriptions, and validation jobs.

### Email Validation Engine
This engine performs multi-layer validation including syntax, DNS lookup, MX record verification, and smart SMTP connectivity testing. It's designed for stability and reliability, processing 25-email batches with timeouts and robust error handling. Ultra-fast SMTP checks (0.5-second timeouts) and concurrent processing via a thread pool executor (20 workers per batch) ensure high performance (15-30 emails/second). It provides real-time progress updates and supports enterprise-scale usage with rate limiting and queue management.

### Phone Number Validation Engine
Built on Google's `libphonenumber` library, this engine offers comprehensive validation including format validation, country detection, carrier identification, and number type classification with international support. It intelligently extracts numbers from text and processes them concurrently for high performance, providing rich metadata like formatted numbers, country info, carrier names, and timezones, alongside graceful error handling.

### File Processing System
The system supports CSV, Excel, and text file formats, performing file validation (size limits, format, security checks). It integrates with `pandas` for efficient data processing and includes secure temporary file management with cleanup.

### Subscription Management
The bot supports cryptocurrency payments for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT, with automated payment verification and subscription activation. It includes a free trial system for a combined 1,000 validations (emails + phones) and tracks user validation usage against subscription limits.

### Configuration Management
Sensitive configurations are managed via environment variables. The system uses a centralized configuration file for all parameters, allowing flexible pricing and trial limit adjustments.
